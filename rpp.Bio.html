		<h1>Biography of RP</h1>
		
			Birthday: May 7th, 1991 <br>
			Hometown: Greenville, SC <br>
			School: Iron Yard Academy <br>
		

			<p>While born in Columbia, South Carolina, Robert was only two when his parents moved to Greenville for his father's new job.  He did the typical childhood hoopla, like play baseball at the YMCA, get in fights with the bigger kids (respectably losing), and learning about the wonderful yet cruel nature of girls. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Wanting to experience something new and get away from the typical ridged ways of the bible belt, he ventured down to Charleston to attend college.  He made his way through four years at the College of Charleston graduating with degrees in Political Science and Philsophy.
			<br>
			<br>
			He wanted to pursue a career in videography upon graduating and was excited to enter the real world.  Much to his dismay, he quickly learned that the real world is a cruel bitch.  But he heard of an opportunity to take a class that would help him in accomplishing his goal.  So he joined the Iron Academy and is here with you today!
